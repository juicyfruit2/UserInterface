## Requirements Analysis

### Ambiguities or Omissions

The following ambiguities or omissions were identified in the statement of requirements for the ticket-issuing system:

1. Method of destination selection is not specified (e.g., touch screen, physical buttons, drop-down menu, etc.).
2. Handling of invalid destination inputs is not defined.
3. Purpose and usage of the personal identification number (PIN) are not clarified.
4. Details of credit card validation process are not mentioned.
5. Ticket delivery method is not specified (e.g., on-site printing, email, mobile app, etc.).

### Non-functional Requirements

Based on the identified ambiguities or omissions, the following set of non-functional requirements can be proposed:

1. Performance: The system should handle a high volume of concurrent users without significant processing delays.
2. Security: Credit card information and personal identifiers should be securely stored and transmitted using appropriate security measures.
3. Usability: The user interface should be intuitive, providing clear instructions and user-friendly error handling.
4. Reliability: The system should be available and functional at all times, with minimal downtime for maintenance or upgrades.
5. Scalability: The system should be designed to accommodate future growth and increased user demand.

## User Interface Evaluations

### Website 1

Please note that as an AI text-based model, I cannot directly access websites or browse the internet. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific evaluation of Website 1. However, I can offer general guidance on evaluating UI design based on the provided information.

Good elements of UI design:
- Visual appeal with consistent color scheme, typography, and graphics.
- Clear navigation menus and buttons for seamless movement between pages.
- Consistency in UI elements throughout the website for a cohesive experience.
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
- Consideration of accessibility factors like color contrast and text size.

Bad elements of UI design:
- Cluttered layout with excessive information.
- Confusing navigation without clear labels or structure.
- Poor readability due to low contrast, small font sizes, or unformatted text.
- Slow loading times that can lead to user impatience.
- Lack of feedback for user actions, such as button clicks or form submissions.

### Website 2

Since no specific website is mentioned in the task, it is not possible to provide an evaluation or analysis for Website 2.
